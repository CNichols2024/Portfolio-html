        <h2 id="headder">Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Chris Nichols and I am a self-taught programmer.
                I picked up coding with python to solve some problems with the devices I use at Blue Line Solutions. I learned by trial, error, and a lot of research.
                I completed that project, and it went on to be implemented in our production units. This resulted in a night and day difference in the confidence of our devices.
                Since then, I have enrolled in 2 Udemy courses. 1 for Linux+ and 1 for full-stack development led by Dr. Angela Yu from App Brewery.
            </p>
            <p>
                My current role is an Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) support technician. I work with a number of units over several states and primarily work with the technical attributes. I have learned how to control, update, and configure Linux based units using Ansible. 
                I also assist field service members and contractors in the field by correcting and confirming the technical and operation status of the unit.
                My current goal is to finish my web development course and start a career in web development.
