        <p>
            My name is Chris Nichols, and I am a self-taught programmer who acquired this skill while employed at Blue Line Solutions as an Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) Support Technician.
            We were encountering a major issue with our devices not responding to changes in the environment caused by weather. Through trial, error, and extensive research, I independently learned how to code in Python and successfully developed a program that would adjust the necessary values in our devices. 
            This program was subsequently approved by my director and implemented in production units.
            This led to a significant increase in our productivity and boosted confidence in our abilities with our clientele.
        </p>

            In my current role, I have learned how to control, update, and configure Linux-based devices en masse using the Ansible system.
            I have also served as the main point of contact for all service needs to maintain and rectify the technical status and operation of ALPR units across six states. 
            My success in this role, coupled with the successful completion of my first coding project, has inspired me to pursue a career in coding.
            I have been taking courses in web development, as well as Python, Linux+, and system administration.
